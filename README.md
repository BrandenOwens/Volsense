A Rather Inaccurate Stock Market Prediction Tool

ðŸ“ˆ Buy Pressure â€“ What It Is

Buy pressure is a rough way to measure how much upward force there was on a stock during the day.

ðŸ§® How It's Calculated

Buy Pressure = volume Ã— (close âˆ’ open) / open
If the stock went up during the day (close > open), buy pressure is positive

If it went down, buy pressure is negative

Volume makes big moves matter more than small ones

ðŸ“Š What the Graph Shows

Each dot = 1 day of buy pressure, scaled from 0 to 100

Green dots = stock closed higher than it opened (bullish)

Red dots = stock closed lower (bearish)

Gray dashed line = midpoint (50)

Red shaded area = low-pressure zone (usually bearish)

ðŸ’¡ In Simple Terms:
The graph helps visualize how strong the bulls or bears were each day â€” but it doesnâ€™t predict the market. Itâ€™s just showing momentum based on price movement and volume.
